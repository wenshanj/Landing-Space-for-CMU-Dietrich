The goal of the project is to work with CMU Associate Director of Corporate Relations to design and prototype a virtual landing space to catalog the many different ways external partners can work with faculty and students in CMU Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences. 

Throughout the process, we drafted a project proposal, conducted competitive analyss, inital interviews to help us created personas for our target audiences, designed lo-fi and mid-fi wireframes, conducted multiple rounds of user testing and wireframe refinement, coded our design using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and presented our design to our client and multiple CMU faculties.
